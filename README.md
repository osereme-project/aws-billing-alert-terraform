## 🔍 Understanding the AWS Services  

### 🌟 AWS CloudWatch  

[AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms. This module uses CloudWatch to monitor your AWS billing and trigger an alarm when specified thresholds are exceeded.  

### 📢 AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)  

[AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) is a fully managed messaging service. It allows you to send notifications to multiple subscribers. In this module, SNS is used to send billing alerts via email, SMS, or other supported channels when the CloudWatch alarm is triggered.  

### 🧾 AWS Billing  

[AWS Billing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-bill/) provides tools to manage your AWS costs and budget. This module automates the monitoring of your AWS billing, so you're notified before your bill goes beyond your expectations.
